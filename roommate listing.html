    <h3>Please leave right now if you will eat me. I'm not interested.</h3>

        <li>I'm a remora.</li>
        <li>All you need to know is that I'm a certified back scratcher.</li>
        <li>I swear I'm not clingy.</li>
        <li>I swear I'm not consumably annoying.</li>
        <li>I need a ride and a roomie willing to provide an endless one, and I ain't explaining why. You got the fins for it or not?</li>
            <div class="image-container">
                <span class="symbol">ÍïÄ</span>
                <img class="image" src="remora.jpg" alt="This is me!!!">
                <span class="symbol">ÍïÄ</span>
            </div>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Offer:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Free Piggyback Rides: You get to ride around with me on your back‚ÄîI'm not going to pay you; you're not my Uber. It's like having a personal chauffeur for life. Or as long as you'll let me.</li>
        <li>My Service; If You're Lucky: Thanks to my impeccable grooming skills, I'll keep you clean and free of those pesky parasites. No more scratching against corals or rocks.</li>
        <li>Endless Vacuuming: Don't worry about cleaning up, I'm here to pick up all the tasty tidbits that escape from your jaws. I am the best maid of the ocean.</li>
        <li>24/7 Entertainment: Who needs Netflix when you've got a live fish show? I'm an expert in acrobatics and can make those long hours of ocean cruising more fun than ever. I will also sit on your shoulders and whisper sweet, sweet nothings into your ear at random.</li>
        <li>Dance Partner: Whether you're a slow, graceful glide or a swift torpedo, I'm here to dance alongside you. We'll be the ocean's Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I'm Looking For in a Roommate:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please be a shark. I won't complain too much if you aren't, but I might leave you for one without letting you know.</li>
        <li>Good dental hygiene - let's keep those pearly whites in tip-top shape so that I don't have to do it for you.</li>
        <li>Must enjoy my eternal presence.</li>
        <li>Don't ask me about anything. Don't perceive me. Ever.</li>
        <li>Don't push me away or scare me because I will get very frightened and I will never do nice things for you. I'll still stay though.</li>
        <li>Preferably, do not eat me.</li>
        <h2>This could be us.</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <span class="symbol">‚ô°</span>
                <img class="image" src="lovin u.jpg" alt="I will luv u!">
                <span class="symbol">‚ô°</span>
            </div>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Apply Now:</strong> If you're a shark who's looking for the ultimate aquatic buddy, hit me up. Just swim on over and let's meet for a test piggyback ride. I promise, you won't find a roommate like me anywhere else. I will be very sad if you do.</h3>
    <p>Remember, it's not just a roommate situation; it's a commensalism relationship that'll make you never want to be alone ever again in your entire lifespan. I'll cling, you glide. Apply, or face the deep alone.</p>
